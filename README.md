[![Build Framework](https://github.com/ublue-os/framework/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ublue-os/framework/actions/workflows/build.yml)

# THIS IMAGE IS DEPRECATED

Framework enablement has been directly added to [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io) and [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg). Additionally all main images for Fedora 40 and newer will have the proper versions of gnome-power-profile. Therefore this image is no longer needed, Frameworks will just work better out of the box.
